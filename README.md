# Zen Docs
Citrus Hack 2021 project.

## Purpose

This application helps users find what their typing speed is. When the user types, the software records the number of words they typed and then performs math to find the WPM (words per minute) measurement.

## Layout

This app was constructed to resemble the Zen visualization style of Citrus Hack. We tried to pick colors that resemble a "Zen" vibe for users to feel comfortable while utilizing our application.

## Developers

This app was made by Ann-Marina Miyaguchi and Ivan Neto in contribution for Citrus Hack 2021.
